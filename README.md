Machine Learning for SAP Hybrid Operations: anomaly status finder

Machine Learning Extension  for SAP monitoring is an extra element between SAP Solution Manager 7.2 system and monitoring experts to address key challenges within SAP Solution Manager 7.2:

- Filtering out of redundant alerts, related to recurring metric behavior variations
- Detection of non-threshold violation related deviations

Key architecture aspects of Machine Learning Extension solution:

• Solution is a set of micro services on Python and Node.js running inside Cloud Foundry environment of MLT SAP HANA XSA

• SAP Solution Manager 7.2 Monitoring and Alerting Infrastructure (MAI) is integrated with the solution, deployed to MLT SAP HANA XSA

• Solution anomaly calculation core is based of Machine Learning algorithms and provides API to calculate real-time anomalies ratings for incoming quantifiable metrics of various nature: solution can extend different monitoring scenarios like Technical Monitoring, Interfaces Monitoring, Business KPIs (resources consumption percentages, amount of users, amount of records in specific tables, orders count etc.)

• Machine Learning model doesn’t require labelling, behavior patterns are modeled uniquely for every metric of every monitoring object in scope

• Machine Learning model needs to be trained at least on past two weeks data (human participation is not needed)

• Once Machine Learning model is trained, metrics and alerts data is pulled by solution from SAP Solution Manager 7.2 MAI every 5 minutes

• Incoming metrics values from MAI are compared with predicted metrics values Machine Learning Anomaly Detection service, and anomalies ratings are calculated

• Anomalies measurements are transferred back to SAP Solution Manager MAI for further alerts reliability evaluation and non-threshold violation related anomalies data provision

Alerts reliability evaluation server pythia is a Node.js application.
